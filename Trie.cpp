// What is Trie?
// Trie is a type of k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a specific key from a set.
// Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 

// Definition: A trie (derived from retrieval) is a multiway tree data structure used for storing strings over an alphabet. 
// It is used to store a large amount of strings. The pattern matching can be done efficiently using tries.

// The trie shows words like allot, alone, ant, and, are, bat, bad. The idea is that all strings sharing common prefix
// should come from a common node. The tries are used in spell checking programs.

// Preprocessing pattern improves the performance of pattern matching algorithm.
// But if a text is very large then it is better to preprocess text instead of pattern for efficient search.
// A trie is a data structure that supports pattern matching queries in time proportional to the pattern size.
// If we store keys in a binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, 
// where M is the maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. 
//Using Trie, the key can be searched in O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements


//ðŸ”¸Trie is also known as digital tree or prefix tree

//                         (root node)
//                     a  /           \ d
//                      (a)           (b)
//                    n /           a/    \o
//                    (n)          (a)    [do]
//                  d/   \t      d/
//               [and]  [ant]   [dad]


//ðŸ”´Structure of Trie node:
// Every node of Trie consists of multiple branches. 
// Each branch represents a possible character of keys. 
// Mark the last node of every key as the end of the word node. 
// A Trie node field isEndOfWord is used to distinguish the node as the end of the word node. 


//ðŸ”´Insert Operation in Trie:
// Inserting a key into Trie is a simple approach. 

// Every character of the input key is inserted as an individual Trie node. Note that the children is an array of pointers (or references) to next-level trie nodes. 
// The key character acts as an index to the array children. 
// If the input key is new or an extension of the existing key, construct non-existing nodes of the key, and mark the end of the word for the last node. 
// If the input key is a prefix of the existing key in Trie, Simply mark the last node of the key as the end of a word. 
// The key length determines Trie depth.

//                           (Root node)                   (Root node)
//                                  |                            |
//                                 (a)                          (a)
// (root node )   ===>              |             ====>          |
//               insert "and"      (n)            insert "ant"   (n)
//                                  |                               \ 
//                                 [d]                               [t]
//                                 and                                ant


// ðŸ”´Advantages of tries
// 1. In tries the keys are searched using common prefixes. Hence it is faster. 
//    The lookup of keys depends upon the height in case of binary search tree. 
// 2. Tries take less space when they contain a large number of short strings.
//    As nodes are shared between the keys.
// 3. Tries help with longest prefix matching, when we want to find the key.

//ðŸ”´Comparison of tries with hash table
// 1. Looking up data in a trie is faster in worst case as compared to imperfect hash table.
// 2. There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.
// 3. In trie if single key is associated with more than one value then it resembles buckets in hash table.
// 4. There is no hash function in trie.
// 5. Sometimes data retrieval from tries is very much slower than hashing.
// 6. Representation of keys a string is complex. For example, representing floating point numbers using strings is really complicated in tries.
// 7. Tries always take more space than hash tables.
//  8. Tries are not available in programming tool it. Hence implementation of tries has to be done from scratch.

//ðŸ”´Applications of tries
// 1. Tries has an ability to insert, delete or search for the entries. 
//   Hence they are used in building dictionaries such as entries for telephone numbers, English words.
// 2. Tries are also used in spell-checking softwares.


//ðŸ”´Search Operation in Trie:
// Searching for a key is similar to the insert operation. However, It only compares the characters and moves down. 
// The search can terminate due to the end of a string or lack of key in the trie. 
// In the former case, if the isEndofWord field of the last node is true, then the key exists in the trie. 
// In the second case, the search terminates without examining all the characters of the key, 
// since the key is not present in the trie.

//                         (root node)
//       search "dad"              \ 
//        ====>                    (d)
///                                / 
//                               (a)
//                               /
//                              [d]    ==> check if( isWordEnd == TRUE)
//                              dad

// Note:
// Insert and search costs O(key_length), however, the memory requirements of Trie is O(ALPHABET_SIZE * key_length * N) where N is the number of keys in Trie.
//  There are efficient representations of trie nodes (e.g. compressed trie, ternary search tree, etc.) 
// to minimize the memory requirements of the trie.

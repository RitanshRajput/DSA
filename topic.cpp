// #include<iostream>   = this is input/output library for the code to understand syntaxes
// using namespace std;  = this is for certain object to works like cout / cin
// int main() = this is our main function within which we will write all our code
// cout<<     = this is used to print anything on the  output screen 
// << endl;   = for newline
// <<'\n';    = for newline
// "hello.\n" =here also \n will print newline or move cursor to new line
// << '\n';   = newline 
// ;          = semi-colon tells that the line is completed/ended to the compiler.

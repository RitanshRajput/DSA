     /********** 🔴🔴 Flowchart   */

//🔸 FLowchart is Diagramatical way to describe the problem statement or a situation before making it into code.
//🔸basic components in flowchart:
//1. Problem
//2.start point/task
//3.input/output condition
//4.process involve
//5.decision to be made
//6.End point/result



//🔘 Components In flowchart:
 
//1. (    )   = start/end          (ellipse)
//2. /      /  =Input/output/print    (read a, b)   (parallelogram)
//3.  |     |  =process/calculation  (i= i+1 )      (rectangle)
//4.  🔷      =decision making /condition making     (if no, if yes )   (Diamond)
//5. ⬆️ ⬇️   =to show flow direction/ connecting components
//6.  🔘    =connector   (circle)




//🔘 Psuedo code  (psuedo means Nakli ):

//🔸Generic Way of representing code/logic/flow to slove the problem/approach

//ex: psudo code for Sum of 2 no.
// => Read a
// => Read b
// => Sum = a+b
// => print sum
